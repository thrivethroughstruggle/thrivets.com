      <p class="lead">VISSION</p>

      <blockquote><p>In this vision, those struggling with depression and anxiety are not stigmatized or misunderstood, but are met with empathy and support. They have access to the resources they need, whether that's professional help, medication, or simply a supportive community of people who understand what they're going through. Online platforms play a crucial role in this vision. They serve as a beacon of hope, providing accessible and reliable information, resources, and support. These platforms are not websites, but communities where people can connect, share their experiences, and lift each other up.</p></blockquote>
